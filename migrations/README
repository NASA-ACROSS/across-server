# ACROSS Database

## Initial Setup

The ACROSS DB must go through a few initial manual steps for any new environment in AWS. This must be completed prior to migrations, and cannot be part of migrations since these are prerequisites for migrations to run successfully. See the [AWS docs for IAM auth](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.Connecting.html) and enabling [POSTGIS extension](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.PostGIS.html)for more context.

The following statements must be executed from the `postgres` superuser. The credentials can be found in the SSM parameter store.

**IMPORTANT:** Take note of the proper env you are accessing. For example,

`/aurora-postgres/across-ue2-dev-core-server-db/admin/password`

will access the dev db.

Below is the sql to run once logged in. You may run into an error creating the `postgis_tiger_geocoder` extension that says a function `soundex` doesn't exist, but it does. You can search for it and it exists under the `public` schema. I do not understand why the next extension sometimes fails to find it. You will have to disconnect and reconnect from the db and continue.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS fuzzystrmatch;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis_tiger_geocoder;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis_topology;

CREATE USER developer;
CREATE USER ci;
CREATE USER core_server;

-- RDS auth privileges
GRANT rds_iam TO developer,ci,core_server;

-- general DB privileges.
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE across TO developer,ci,core_server;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA across TO developer,ci,core_server;

-- current tables
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA across TO developer, ci, core_server;

-- future tables
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA across GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO developer, ci, core_server;
```
